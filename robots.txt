Here is a fun short story...

Lost Journal Entries of a Blue Teamer:

Day 1:

Found an odd directory on the website today. Not sure how it got there, but it doesn't look right. Spent hours trying to trace it back but hit a dead end.

Day 3:

The same directory popped up. This is getting frustrating. Checked the logs, but nothing seems off. Starting to feel like I'm chasing ghosts.

Day 7:

Spent the whole day scanning for vulnerabilities. Sadly I haven't found anything that could restore our services.

Day 10:

Got an alert about a potential breach. Heart raced, but it was a false alarm. Starting to feel paranoid. Everyone else says it's secure, but I can't shake this feeling.

Day 14:

Couldn't sleep. Came in early to dig deeper. Still can't find anything concrete. Maybe I'm missing something obvious?

Day 21:

Had a meltdown in the office today. Convinced someone's messing with me. Everyone thinks I'm overreacting. Maybe I am. But I know it's not here. It can't be.

Day 28:

Decided to take a break from the search. Went for a walk, tried to clear my head. Still no closer to figuring it out. Feeling defeated.

Day 35:

Found the source of the weird directories. Turns out, it was a glitch from an old system update. Feel both relieved and embarrassed. Time to clean up and move on.


Congrats on wasting time! :)

Now quit procrastinating and get back to work!!
